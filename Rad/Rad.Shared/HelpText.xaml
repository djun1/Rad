                Several image options are provided in the Radar Imagery app, depending on which country is selected.
                A  description of each option follows below to help you choose which product is the most suitable.

            <Paragraph>
                CAPPI (Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator) products show radar returns from approximately one height above the ground (i.e. 1.5 km).
                These products are produced by making a series of radar beams at different elevation angles.
                There is no Doppler processing to filter out clutter.

                PRECIPET products are designed to show precipitation close to the ground.
                Doppler processing is used to filter out false echoes from ground objects, such as buildings.

            <Paragraph>
                A less sensitive reflectivity relationship is used for rain, as it returns strong radar signals compared to snow.
                CAPPI products show returns from a constant height of 1.0 km above the surface.

            <Paragraph>
                Since snow does not reflect radar beams effectively, a sensitive reflectivity relationship is used.
                CAPPI products show returns from a constant height of 1.5 km above the surface.

            <Paragraph>
                Base images are generated from the lowest tilt angle of the antenna at 0.5°.
                Returns generally show precipitation near the surface.

                Composite images display the maximum intensity from any elevation height at every distance from the radar.
                These products can show storm structures and intensity trends.
